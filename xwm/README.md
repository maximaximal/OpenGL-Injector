This version of the window manager is based on X11. It is based on 
[basic_wm](https://github.com/jichu4n/basic_wm) and expanded it to
be integrated into the piga system. 

Why use this version instead of QWM?
====================================

Because this is based on X11, more applications are compatible with this window manager. In addition,
the driver support on X11 is better, which means this window manager would run on more devices.

On top of that, XWM has fewer dependencies and also runs on Debian Stretch.
